# Translations

Please note the content in the game is highly volatile, but any translations would still be highly appreciated.

1. Add your language shortcode to app/src/internationalization/index.ts
2. Copy app/src/internationalization/lang/en.json to app/src/internationalization/lang/\<your-shortcode\>.json
3. Update the translation file with your language
4. Run `yarn formatjs:compile:all` in the app directory (or add your own yarn script as per the examples)
5. Run the app locally and check the translation
6. Send a pull request :-)
