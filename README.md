# Infinitris 2
Infinitris 2 is a massively multiplayer falling block puzzle game. Place blocks on a giant grid that expands and contracts based on the number of players in-game. Gain score by stealing cells and helping to clear lines in an unending power struggle.

More information can be found in our [Wiki](https://github.com/rolznz/infinitris2/wiki/Home).

# Installation

Please see the [Server Readme](server/README.md) and the [Client Readme](client/README.md)

NB: Infinitris is currently in design phase. A minimal prototype to test our ideas will hopefully be coming soon.

# Sequel
Infinitris 2 attempts to deal with many issues raised in [Infinitris.io](https://github.com/rolznz/infinitris2/wiki/infinitris.io) by providing simpler and more intuitive mechanics and a power balance which rewards skilled players.
