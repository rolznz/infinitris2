# Abandoned
Infinitris.io was abandoned for a few reasons - Azure hosting costs, no revenue, lack of user retention due to poor design choices.

Allowing 10+ players on a single grid created many challenges, some which were solved in ways that either were confusing to the user.

* Grid expansion / contraction sometimes caused players to make mistakes
* Grid resets (When the grid is too full) happened seemingly randomly
* Mistake detection not allowing players to use standard strategies to clear lines and didn't account for players creating bridge structures with large gaps
* Point allocation was overcomplicated
* All a person's contributions were deleted when their score is too low, causing damage the grid and affecting other players. (Introduced to target Troll / AFK detection)
* Phase shifting made things too easy for people who new how to use it, and confused everyone else
* Slow performance (Inefficient game rendering and React state updates)

Worst of all, most users wanted to play on their own. This completely defeated the point of Infinitris.io.
